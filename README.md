HTTP Server and Client Using Python Socket Programming

This project features a basic implementation of an HTTP server and client using Python's socket module. The server is designed to handle GET and POST requests, responding with simple HTML messages for each type of request. The client script connects to the server, sends an HTTP request, and prints the received response. This setup is useful for understanding fundamental HTTP communication and socket programming in Python.
